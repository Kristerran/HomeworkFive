# HomeworkFive
<<<<<<< HEAD
Day Planner app. Fifth homework project for web development bootcamp When document first loaded, user will be prompted to enter start time of shift and hours they will be working that day(slightly buggy, will only work if hours do not continue into next day (such as choosing over 24 hours etc) if user chooses over one full day, additional slides will show as "invalid date" didn't have time to fix this bug, I may resubmit after reworking how that section of code works. after user inputs time for that day, additional reloads will save that preference of time. User will only be prompted again if local storage is cleared or user clicks "new day" button and confirms.

Each hour is shown as an input with a save button next to it, if user inputs to do list in the input and clicks save button, the system will keep that input if page reloads (in future iterations I would like to add a function to change color/styling of text apon save to make it easier to confirm.) Users inputs will stay on reload unless new day button clicked (new day button clears local storage)
